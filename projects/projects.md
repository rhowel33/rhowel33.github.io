# Personal Projects


## Audiobooks
Over the years my family has collected a lot of audiobooks.
Now that we have moved out, it is hard to get access to books we own. 
After some searching I found a Github Repository, Audiobookshelf. 
It was a personal Audible, a personaudible, if you will.

I thought, I have an extra RaspberryPi 4b lying arround, I can set Audiobookshelf on it and be done in no time.

I set it up in docker container running on my RaspberryPi 4b.
It worked well enough for one or two people listening to books at a time, but it became clear that it needed a bit more hardware power to get it to work for my family.
I found a cheap old desktop computer that I could repurpose into a Ubuntu server where I could host my Library.

## Chess clock

Since early in the Covid-19 pandemic, I became enamored by the game of chess. 
Like many people, I made a <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/rhowel33">chess.com</a> account and started solving puzzles and playing games. 
Puzzle solving was more fun to me because given enough time, I should be able to find the right move. 
There was thrill when I would win chess games and utter disappointment when I lost. 

I started to improve and wanted to try my hand at chess in real life. 
I got a US Chess Federation membership and started playing in some small tournaments.
Most small tournaments asked for a chess board and a chess clock to be brought a long to the events to keep costs down. 
Looking online at the chess clocks and seeing them go for around $60.00 each, I thought to myself how hard could it be to make my own.
I found my old Arduino Uno that I had used for one of my Electrical Engineering classes and started trying to build a clock.

After finding a breadboard, small buttons, an LCD screen (bought off of eBay), resistors, and about a million jumper wires, I had all the hardware that I needed to start.
Though my coding expertise is in primarily Python, I quickly recalled the basics of C++ and the little Arduino C that I had learned.
With my C++ memory refreshed, I started the joy of troubleshooting with hardware sourced from not very reputable sellers.
Troubleshooting my poor solder joints, less than neat code, or the hardware was a lot of work. 
When I finally had a half working clock, the LCD screen decided that it would only show the left half of the screen. Unfortunate.
I have shelved this project until I can source a cheap but reliable replacement screen.
