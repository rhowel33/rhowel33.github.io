          Audiobooks Home
        </header>

        <p>
          Over the years my family has collected a lot of audiobooks.
          Now that we have moved out, it is hard to get access to books we own. 
          After some searching I found a Github Repository, Audiobookshelf. 
          It was a personal Audible, a personaudible, if you will.
          <div style="text-align: center;">
          <img src="/assets/images/abs.png" alt="GIF 3" width=200px>

        </p>
        <p>
          I thought, I have an extra RaspberryPi 4b lying arround, I can set Audiobookshelf on it and be done in no time.
        </p>
        <p>
          I set it up in docker container running on my RaspberryPi 4b.
          It worked well enough for one or two people listening to books at a time, but it became clear that it needed a bit more hardware power to get it to work for my family.
          I found a cheap old desktop computer that I could repurpose into a Ubuntu server where I could host my Library.

          Homemade Chess clock (hopefully cheaper)
        </header>
        <p>
          Since early in the Covid-19 pandemic, I became enamored by the game of chess. 
        Like many people, I made a <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/rhowel33">chess.com</a> account and started solving puzzles and playing games. 
        Puzzle solving was more fun to me because given enough time, I should be able to find the right move. 
        There was thrill when I would win chess games and utter disappointment when I lost. 
        </p>
        

        <p>I started to improve and wanted to try my hand at chess in real life. 
        I got a US Chess Federation membership and started playing in some small tournaments.
        Most small tournaments asked for a chess board and a chess clock to be brought a long to the events to keep costs down. 
        Looking online at the chess clocks and seeing them go for around $60.00 each, I thought to myself how hard could it be to make my own.
        I found my old Arduino Uno that I had used for one of my Electrical Engineering classes and started trying to build a clock.</p>
        

      <p>
        After finding a breadboard, small buttons, an LCD screen (bought off of eBay), resistors, and about a million jumper wires, I had all the hardware that I needed to start.
        Though my coding expertise is in primarily Python, I quickly recalled the basics of C++ and the little Arduino C that I had learned.
        With my C++ memory refreshed, I started the joy of troubleshooting with hardware sourced from not very reputable sellers.
        Troubleshooting my poor solder joints, less than neat code, or the hardware was a lot of work. 
        When I finally had a half working clock, the LCD screen decided that it would only show the left half of the screen. Unfortunate.
        I have shelved this project until I can source a cheap but reliable replacement screen.
