I'm a recent graduate from Brigham Young University, holding a Bachelor of Science
in Applied Mathematics with a concentration in mechanical engineering.
During my time at BYU, I did research on the N-body problem. Specifically looking
at different equilibrium configurations and their stabilities, such as the figure 8
configuration.

My passion lies in the realm of both software and hardware, particularly in the
pursuit of projects centered around machine learning and computational applications
that have a positive impact on the world.
I thrive on problem-solving, relishing the challenge of fixing anything that's broken â€“
be it mechanical systems or lines of code.

Beyond my technical pursuits, I enjoy indulging in hobbies such as watching movies,
reading, biking, playing chess, and cooking good food.
