## About

I'm a recent graduate from Brigham Young University, with a Bachelor of Science
in Applied Mathematics with a concentration in mechanical engineering.
During my time at BYU, I did research on the N-body problem. Specifically looking
at different equilibrium configurations and their stabilities, such as the figure 8
configuration. I also worked on a team investigating the possible locations of
earthquake epicenters based on records of earthquakes and tsunamis before the
seismograph.

My passion lies in the realm of both software and hardware, particularly in the
pursuit of projects centered around machine learning and computational applications
that have a positive impact on the world.
I thrive on problem-solving, relishing the challenge of fixing anything that's broken â€“
be it mechanical systems or lines of code. I host my own server for media, back-ups and intense coding programs.


## Projects

Below are some of animations of my work, including 3 body problem, The Figure 8 Orbit,
and the Hiphop Orbit.
There is also a wavelet transform of time series data representing the river water quality
from across the United States.
There is also a picture of my chess at home, handdrawn set.

## Personal

Beyond my technical pursuits, I enjoy indulging in hobbies such as watching movies,
reading, biking, playing chess, and cooking good food. *Ratatouille*, being a blend of good
animation, cooking, and a great story telling, is one of my all time favorites.
