# Hi, I'm Reagan
I'm a recent graduate from Brigham Young University, holding a Bachelor of Science
in Applied Mathematics with a concentration in mechanical engineering.
During my time at BYU, I did research in the 3-body problem.

My passion lies in the realm of both software and hardware, particularly in the
pursuit of projects centered around machine learning and computational applications
that have a positive impact on the world.
I thrive on problem-solving, relishing the challenge of fixing anything that's broken â€“
be it mechanical systems or lines of code.

Beyond my technical pursuits, I enjoy indulging in hobbies such as watching movies,
reading, biking, playing chess, and savoring good food.
Welcome to my portfolio, where I showcase my journey and accomplishments.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.

# Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.

> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item

  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
